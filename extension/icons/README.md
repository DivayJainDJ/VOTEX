# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Live Text Enhancement Extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should represent the live text enhancement functionality, possibly incorporating:
- Microphone symbol (for speech input)
- Text/document symbol (for text output)
- Enhancement/improvement indicator (like sparkles or arrows)

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing purposes, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions and names. The extension will load without icons, but they improve the user experience.

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Online icon generators
- Icon libraries (Font Awesome, Material Icons, etc.)
- AI image generators

Make sure all icons are in PNG format with transparent backgrounds for best results.
