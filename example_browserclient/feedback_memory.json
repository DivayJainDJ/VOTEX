We often wait for the perfect moment, the perfect plan or the perfect skill. That will before we begin something you haunted. But the truth is, great journey begin with imperfect steps. Every day we have a chance to move a little closer to the future. We imagine we're learning, trying, failing and trying again. So don't roll yourself back. Start now, start small, but start. because the best time to believe in yourself is today. Thank you.",
